## Inspiration

I'm trying to surround myself with some clean, modern, unique and almost "state of art" UI's. I've got some inspirations in some of the best design engineers and a deep inspiration in the [Animations on the Web](https://animations.dev/) course by [Emil Kowalski](https://twitter.com/emilkowalski_).
